# Use an Azure AI Services Container

Using Azure AI services hosted in Azure enables application developers to focus on the infrastructure for their own code while benefiting from scalable services that are managed by Microsoft. However, in many scenarios, organizations require more control over their service infrastructure and the data that is passed between services.

Many of the Azure AI services APIs can be packaged and deployed in a *container*, enabling organizations to host Azure AI services in their own infrastructure; for example in local Docker servers, Azure Container Instances, or Azure Kubernetes Services clusters. Containerized Azure AI services need to communicate with an Azure-based Azure AI services account to support billing; but application data is not passed to the back-end service, and organizations have greater control over the deployment configuration of their containers, enabling custom solutions for authentication, scalability, and other considerations.

> **Note**: There is an issue currently being investigated that some users hit where containers won't deploy properly, and calls to those containers fail. Updates to this lab will be made as soon as the issue has been resolved.

## Clone the repository for this course in Cloud Shell

Open up a new browser tab to work with Cloud Shell. If you haven't cloned this repository to Cloud Shell recently, follow the steps below to make sure you have the most recent version. Otherwise, open Cloud Shell and navigate to your clone.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of the portal.

    ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png#lightbox)

2. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **Bash**. If you don't see this option, skip the step.  

3. If you're prompted to create storage for your Cloud Shell, ensure your subscription is specified and select **Create storage**. Then wait a minute or so for the storage to be created.

4. Make sure the type of shell indicated on the top left of the Cloud Shell pane is switched to *Bash*. If it's *PowerShell*, switch to *Bash* by using the drop-down menu.

5. Once the terminal starts, enter the following command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called `labs`.

    ```bash
    rm -r labs -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-services labs
    ```
  
6. The files are downloaded to a folder named **labs**. Navigate to the lab files for this exercise using the following command.

    ```bash
    cd labs/Labfiles/04-use-a-container
    ```

Use the following command to open the lab files in the built-in code editor.

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## Provision an Azure AI Services resource

If you don't already have one in your subscription, you'll need to provision an **Azure AI Services** resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. In the top search bar, search for *Azure AI services*, select **Azure AI Services**, and create an Azure AI services multi-service account resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)*
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0
3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. When the resource has been deployed, go to it and view its **Keys and Endpoint** page. You will need the endpoint and one of the keys from this page in the next procedure.

## Deploy and run a Text Analytics container

Many commonly used Azure AI services APIs are available in container images. For a full list, check out the [Azure AI services documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support#container-availability-in-azure-cognitive-services). In this exercise, you'll use the container image for the Text Analytics *language detection* API; but the principles are the same for all of the available images.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *container instances*, and create a **Container Instances** resource with the following settings:

    - **Basics**:
        - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
        - **Resource group**: *Choose the resource group containing your Azure AI services resource*
        - **Container name**: *Enter a unique name*
        - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
        - **Availability zones**: *None*
        - **SKU**: *Standard*
        - **Image source**: Other Registry
        - *Run with Azure Spot discount* : *Unselected*
        - **Image type**: *Public*
        - **Image**: `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language:latest`
        - **OS type**: Linux
        - **Size**: 1 vcpu, 12 GB memory
    - **Networking**:
        - **Networking type**: *Public*
        - **DNS name label**: *Enter a unique name for the container endpoint*
        - **DNS name label scope reuse**: *Tenant*
        - **Ports**: *Change the TCP port from 80 to **5000***
    - **Advanced**:
        - **Restart policy**: On failure
        - **Environment variables**:

            | Mark as secure | Key | Value |
            | -------------- | --- | ----- |
            | Yes | `ApiKey` | *Either key for your Azure AI services resource* |
            | Yes | `Billing` | *The endpoint URI for your Azure AI services resource* |
            | No | `Eula` | `accept` |

        - **Command override**: [ ]
        - **Key management**: *Microsoft-managed keys (MMK)*
    - **Tags**:
        - *Don't add any tags*

2. Select **Review + create** then select **Create**. Wait for deployment to complete, and then go to the deployed resource.
    > **Note** Please note that deploying an Azure AI container to Azure Container Instances typically takes 5-10 minutes (provisioning) before they are ready to use.
3. Observe the following properties of your container instance resource on its **Overview** page:
    - **Status**: This should be *Running*.
    - **IP Address**: This is the public IP address you can use to access your container instances.
    - **FQDN**: This is the *fully-qualified domain name* of the container instances resource, you can use this to access the container instances instead of the IP address.

    > **Note**: In this exercise, you've deployed the Azure AI services container image for text translation to an Azure Container Instances (ACI) resource. You can use a similar approach to deploy it to a *[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)* host on your own computer or network by running the following command (on a single line) to deploy the language detection container to your local Docker instance, replacing *&lt;yourEndpoint&gt;* and *&lt;yourKey&gt;* with your endpoint URI and either of the keys for your Azure AI services resource.
    > The command will look for the image on your local machine, and if it doesn't find it there it will pull it from the *mcr.microsoft.com* image registry and deploy it to your Docker instance. When deployment is complete, the container will start and listen for incoming requests on port 5000.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 12g --cpus 1 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language:latest Eula=accept Billing=<yourEndpoint> ApiKey=<yourKey>
    ```

## Use the container

1. In your editor, open **rest-test.sh** and edit the **curl** command it contains (shown below), replacing *&lt;your_ACI_IP_address_or_FQDN&gt;* with the IP address or FQDN for your container.

    ```curl
    curl -X POST "http://<your_ACI_IP_address_or_FQDN>:5000/text/analytics/v3.0/languages" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-ascii "{'documents':[{'id':1,'text':'Hello world.'},{'id':2,'text':'Salut tout le monde.'}]}"
    ```

2. Save your changes to the script by pressing **CTRL+S**. Note that you do not need to specify the Azure AI services endpoint or key - the request is processed by the containerized service. The container in turn communicates periodically with the service in Azure to report usage for billing, but does not send request data.
3. Enter the following command to run the script:

    ```bash
    sh rest-test.sh
    ```

4. Verify that the command returns a JSON document containing information about the language detected in the two input documents (which should be English and French).

## Clean Up

If you've finished experimenting with your container instance, you should delete it.

1. In the Azure portal, open the resource group where you created your resources for this exercise.
2. Select the container instance resource and delete it.
